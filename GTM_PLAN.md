## 1. Target customer

### Primary

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Who** | Ableton Live users who want evolving, generative-style patterns **without** AI or black-box randomness. Producers, electronic composers, sound designers. |
| **Jobs-to-be-done** | “Break writer’s block,” “get patterns that feel alive but I can control,” “something that sounds intentional, not random.” |
| **Psychographics** | Curious about process music (Reich, minimalism); likes tweaking parameters; skeptical of “AI music”; values transparency and control. |
| **Where they are** | r/ableton, r/WeAreTheMusicMakers, r/MaxMSP, Ableton forum, KVR, Gearslutz/ Gearspace, YouTube (Ableton tutorials, M4L roundups), Discord (Ableton, production). |

### Secondary (post-VST)

- Logic, FL Studio, Cubase users who want the same “phase-based generative” workflow in their DAW.
- Game / film composers looking for adaptive or process-based MIDI tools.

## 2. Positioning and messaging

### Positioning statement

**For** Ableton producers who want evolving, musical patterns without AI, **Drifter** (by Stria) is a **phase-based generative sequencer** that **turns one pattern into endlessly shifting variations using Reich-style phasing**. Unlike AI or randomizers, **it uses transparent, mathematical rules** so you stay in control and the result stays musical.

### Key messages

| Message | Use when |
|---------|----------|
| **“One pattern, many phases.”** | Headline; explain the core mechanic in one line. |
| **“Logic, not AI.”** | Differentiate from Suno/Udio; appeal to “anti-soulless” sentiment. |
| **“Artist-driven algorithmic music.”** | About page, long-form; DMA credibility. |
| **“Infinite variations from a single idea — you choose the idea.”** | Emphasize user control of the primary sequence. |
| **“Research-grade phasing, built for the studio.”** | Pro / expert positioning; optional “DMA in Composition” mention. |

### Tagline options

- **“Phase-based generative sequencing.”**
- **“One pattern. Two playheads. Endless drift.”**
- **“Generative without the black box.”**

### What not to say

- Avoid “AI,” “machine learning,” “neural” in product copy (unless explicitly contrasting).
- Don’t oversell “random” — stress **deterministic + controllable drift**.

## 3. Pricing and packaging

### MVP (M4L only)

| Option | Price | Rationale |
|--------|------|------------|
| **Launch price** | **$29** | Boutique tier; low enough for impulse try, high enough to signal quality. Aligns with Isotonik “single device” band. |
| **Alternative** | **Free / pay-what-you-want (beta)** | Maximize installs and feedback first; add paid tier when you add features or remove “beta.” |
| **Post-beta** | **$35–39** | After 2–3 months of feedback and a v1.1; move toward Fors-adjacent positioning. |

**Recommendation:** Start at **$29** or **free beta with optional tip**; move to **$35–39** when you ship v1.1 (e.g. 3rd playhead, coincidence mode) and drop “beta.”

### Later (VST / suite)

- **VST (RNBO):** **$49–59** (standalone plugin, all DAWs).
- **M4L + VST bundle:** **$59–69** (discount vs. buying both).
- **Future suite:** If you add more devices, **$80–99** bundle (see [research/market.md](research/market.md)).

## 4. Channels and tactics

### 4.1 Owned

| Asset | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Landing page / Gumroad** | Single URL: what it is, short demo, buy or download. |
| **Product name + one-liner** | “Drifter — Phase-based generative sequencing for Ableton. By Planedrifter.” |
| **Readme / quick start** | 3–5 steps in the box or PDF; reduces support and refunds. |
| **Email (optional)** | Gumroad or Mailchimp signup for “updates + early access to VST”; build list for launch. |

### 4.2 Earned (community + content)

| Channel | Tactic | When |
|---------|--------|------|
| **r/ableton** | Post “I made a free/paid M4L device that does Reich-style phasing — here’s a demo” with short video. Follow rules (no spam); be helpful in comments. | Launch week. |
| **r/MaxMSP** | Same post, more technical angle (“built in Max, transport-synced, gen~ for phase”). | Launch week. |
| **r/WeAreTheMusicMakers** | Softer post: “Tool for generative patterns without AI.” | Launch week or +1. |
| **Ableton forum** | Share in “Max for Live” or “Share your work”; link to maxforlive.com or Gumroad. | Launch. |
| **KVR** | Post in “Product Announcements”; consider “Developer Spotlight” if they offer. | Launch; again at VST release. |
| **maxforlive.com** | List device (free or paid); use for SEO and “Ableton people searching for sequencers.” | As soon as MVP is packaged. |
| **YouTube** | One **demo video** (2–4 min): what it is, one pattern, twist drift, hear result. Optional: “How I used phase to write this techno loop” (educational, DMA angle). | Before or at launch. |
| **TikTok / Instagram (optional)** | 30–60 sec “before/after” or “one pattern, endless drift” clip; link in bio. | If you already use them. |

### 4.3 Paid (optional, later)

- **Not recommended for MVP.** Use time instead of money: one strong demo + 3–5 community posts.
- **Later:** Small Reddit or Facebook ad budget to “Ableton + electronic production” if you have a VST and want to test scale.

### 4.4 Partnerships and distribution

| Partner | When | How |
|---------|------|-----|
| **Gumroad** | MVP launch | Primary sales; simple, low overhead. |
| **maxforlive.com** | MVP launch | Listing (free or paid) for discovery. |
| **Isotonik Studios** | After v1.1 or when device is polished | Submit for curation; they take a cut but bring audience. Prepare a short pitch + demo. |
| **Plugin Boutique / ADSR** | VST launch | Apply as developer; list Phasing Engine VST. |

## 5. Launch sequence

### Pre-launch (2–4 weeks before MVP ready)

- [ ] **Landing:** Gumroad page (or simple site) with name, one-liner, “Notify me” or “Launch price $29.”
- [ ] **Demo video:** Record 2–4 min walkthrough; upload unlisted, then public at launch.
- [ ] **Readme / quick start:** In the box or PDF; test with one friend.
- [ ] **Copy:** Short description for Gumroad, maxforlive.com, Reddit (adapt tone per channel).

### Launch week

- [ ] **Publish** on Gumroad (and optionally maxforlive.com same day).
- [ ] **Post** to r/ableton, r/MaxMSP (and optionally r/WeAreTheMusicMakers) with demo link and honest “I built this because…” story.
- [ ] **Ableton forum:** One post in the right subforum with link.
- [ ] **KVR:** Product announcement.

## 6. Content plan (minimal)

| Content | Format | Message | When |
|---------|--------|---------|------|
| **Demo video** | 2–4 min, screen + audio | What it is, one pattern, drift, result. “One pattern, many phases.” | Pre-launch. |
| **Launch post** | Reddit/forum text + link | “I made an M4L device that does Reich-style phasing; here’s a demo.” No hype; helpful. | Launch. |
| **Product page copy** | Gumroad / landing | 2–3 short paragraphs: problem, solution, key differentiator (logic not AI). Bullets for features. | Pre-launch. |
| **Optional: “How I used it”** | 5–10 min video or blog | “How I used phase and one pattern to write this loop” — educational, DMA angle. | 2–4 weeks post-launch. |

---

## 7. Success metrics

### MVP launch (first 2–3 months)

| Metric | Target | Use |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **Downloads / purchases** | 50–200 (adjust if free vs paid) | Validation that anyone wants it. |
| **Feedback** | 5+ usable comments or DMs | Input for v1.1 and messaging. |
| **Refunds** | &lt; 5% (if paid) | Quality and fit check. |
| **Repeat visibility** | 1–2 “where can I get this?” or shares | Word of mouth. |

### Longer term (v1.1 + VST)

| Metric | Target | Use |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **Monthly revenue (M4L)** | $100–400 | Side-hustle baseline (see [research/market.md](research/market.md)). |
| **Email list** | 100+ (if you collect) | Own audience for VST launch. |
| **Isotonik / retailer interest** | 1 serious conversation | Distribution and credibility. |

---

## 8. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **No one sees the launch post** | Post at a good time (weekday evening or weekend); be helpful, not salesy; consider 2–3 subreddits over a week. |
| **“Too niche”** | Lean into niche: “For people who want generative without AI.” Niche can pay. |
| **Price sensitivity** | Offer launch price or free beta; raise price with v1.1. |
| **Support overload** | Readme + one FAQ; “Known issues” in the box. |

---

## 9. Checklist summary

**Pre-launch:** Landing (Gumroad), demo video, readme, copy for all channels.  
**Launch:** Publish → r/ableton, r/MaxMSP, Ableton forum, KVR, maxforlive.com, social.  
**Post-launch:** Support, collect feedback, one “what we’re changing” update, optional second video.
