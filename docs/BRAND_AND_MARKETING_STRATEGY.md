# Brand & Marketing Strategy: Stria

Marketing and brand strategy for Stria's products (starting with Drift), using **Fors** as the reference model. Aligns with [GTM_PLAN.md](../GTM_PLAN.md) and [research/market.md](../research/market.md).

---

## 1. Why Fors is the model

Fors (fors.fm) is a small Swedish team—former Elektron developer + design—building Max for Live and native plugins. They’ve become the **gold standard for boutique M4L**: premium price ($39–59), strong word of mouth, and a clear identity that doesn’t rely on big budgets.

What they do well:

| Dimension | Fors approach | Why it works |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Positioning** | “Novel instruments that are elegant to use and adventurous in sound.” No mention of “AI,” “revolutionary,” or feature wars. | Trust and clarity; appeals to serious users. |
| **Product naming** | Single words: Opal, Pivot, Tela, Sala, Gem, Mass, Dust, Slate, Void, Flux. Evocative, not descriptive. | Memorable; feels like a product family, not a catalog. |
| **Copy tone** | Confident, minimal, no hype. “No-nonsense FM synth.” “Ceremonial reverb.” “Boiled down to its essentials.” | Sounds expert and calm; no oversell. |
| **Product page structure** | Type + price first → short experiential description → “Meet the engines” / deep dive → artist packs → specs last. | Experience before specs; artists add credibility. |
| **Visual** | Clean, Elektron-inspired; two-tone, scalable UI. Playful but not toy-like. | Signals “pro tool” and “designed.” |
| **Community** | Artist packs: “We asked artists we love to create sounds.” Short, poetic artist bios; download banks. | Social proof + inspiration without influencer hype. |
| **Pricing** | $29–59; no discounts in your face. “For your consideration.” | Confident; supports “premium boutique.” |

**Takeaway:** Fors sells **identity and craft** as much as features. Planedrifter should aim for the same: one clear idea, one strong name, minimal confident copy, and a product experience that feels “designed” and expert-led.

## 2. Principles (borrowed from Fors)

### 2.1 Name and product family

- **One strong name per product** — not “Phasing Engine Pro” or “Planedrifter Phase Sequencer.” The product has its own name (**Drifter**); Planedrifter is the brand.
- **Brand name** should be memorable and ownable; product names can be single words that evoke the behavior (drift, phase, fold, shift).
- **Consistency** — if you add more devices later, keep the same naming pattern (single word, evocative).

### 2.2 Voice and tone

- **Confident, not loud.** No “revolutionary,” “game-changing,” “ultimate.” Say what it is and why it’s good; let the user decide.
- **Minimal.** Short sentences. One idea per line. Cut filler.
- **Expert but not cold.** You can mention process (Reich, phasing, algorithm); don’t hide the craft. Avoid jargon for its own sake.
- **No AI buzzwords.** Don’t say “AI-powered” or “neural”; do say “logic,” “rules,” “transparent,” “you stay in control.”

### 2.3 Product page structure (Fors-style)

1. **Headline:** Product type (e.g. “phase sequencer” or “generative sequencer”), not a slogan.
2. **Price + primary CTA** (Buy / Get).
3. **One short paragraph** that describes the *experience* — what it feels like to use it, not a feature list.
4. **Optional second paragraph** — another angle (e.g. “Drum synthesizer” / “Sequencer” style split like Opal).
5. **Demo / media** — video or audio that shows the character of the device.
6. **“Meet the…”** — if you have distinct parts (playheads, clock, sequencer), name them and give each one line.
7. **Features / “To sum it up”** — bullet list for people who want the checklist.
8. **Requirements** — platform, Live version, etc., at the end.
9. **Optional: artists / community** — “Made with [Product]” or “Artist presets” when you have them.

### 2.4 Visual identity

- **UI:** Clean, two-tone or limited palette. No clip art or busy graphics. Typography and spacing do the work.
- **Icons / logo:** Simple, recognizable; works small (device icon, favicon).
- **Photos:** If you use them, avoid stock “happy producer at laptop.” Prefer device-only, or your own studio, or nothing.
- **Consistency:** Same font family and color logic across site, Gumroad, and device UI.

### 2.5 Community and proof

- **Artist packs / “Made with”** — Once you have users, ask 2–3 artists you respect to make a short clip or preset pack. Short blurb about them (Fors-style: one sentence, warm, specific). Free download for owners.
- **No fake testimonials.** Real quotes or nothing.
- **“Let the machine surprise you”** — Fors invites play. You can invite “hear what one pattern becomes” or “capture the moment when the phases align.”

## 3. Planedrifter brand strategy

### 3.1 Brand role

- **Planedrifter** = the brand (artist-led, algorithmic, phase-based tools).
- **First product** = **Drifter** — the phase sequencer. Use “Drifter” as the product name and “Planedrifter” as the house name (“Drifter by Planedrifter” or “Planedrifter — Drifter”).
- **Future products:** Give each new device a distinct single word (e.g. Fold, Shift); keep “Planedrifter” as the brand.

### 3.2 Brand promise (one sentence)

**Drifter gives you phase-based generative sequencing—one pattern, many phases—with transparent logic and full control.**

### 3.3 Voice attributes

| Attribute | Meaning for Planedrifter |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Clear** | Say “phase sequencer,” “two playheads,” “drift”; no vague “generative magic.” |
| **Confident** | “Research-grade phasing.” “You choose the pattern; the engine does the rest.” |
| **Warm** | Invite play and curiosity: “Hear what one idea becomes.” “Capture the moment.” |
| **Expert** | OK to mention Reich, process music, algorithm; signals depth without boasting. |

### 3.4 Messaging hierarchy

**Tier 1 (headline / hero)**  
- “One pattern, many phases.”  
- “Phase-based generative sequencing for Ableton.”

**Tier 2 (product page / short copy)**  
- “Two playheads drift over your pattern. Transparent, musical, no AI—just logic you can hear and control.”  
- “Infinite variations from a single idea. You define the idea; Drifter handles the phase.”

**Tier 3 (long-form / about / education)**  
- “Artist-driven algorithmic music. Built from process music and deterministic phasing—research-grade, built for the studio.”  
- Optional: “From the same discipline as Reich’s phase pieces: one pattern, shifting in time.”

**Tier 4 (differentiation)**  
- “Logic, not AI.” “Generative without the black box.” “You stay in control.”

### 3.5 Naming and taglines

| Element | Recommendation |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Product name (MVP)** | **Drifter** (by Planedrifter). |
| **Tagline** | “Phase-based generative sequencing.” or “One pattern. Two playheads. Endless drift.” |
| **Short descriptor** | “Drifter — Phase sequencer for Ableton.” |
| **Future products** | Single words: e.g. Fold, Shift, Loop — keep the same family feel. |

## 4. Visual and design direction

### 4.1 Aspiration (Fors-like)

- **Minimal:** Plenty of space; few UI elements; no decorative clutter.
- **Two-tone or limited palette:** e.g. dark background + one accent (soft white/cream for text, one color for active/phase). Or light theme with one strong accent.
- **Typography:** One clear sans for UI and one for headings/copy; readable at small sizes.
- **Motion:** If you add phase visualization, keep it slow and legible (like Lissajous or gentle orbits), not flashy.

### 4.2 What to avoid

- Neon gradients, “tech” clip art, stock photos of producers.
- Crowded panels, tiny type, or “plugin warehouse” aesthetic.
- Overly playful or toy-like (we’re not a game); we’re “instrument” not “toy.”

### 4.3 Practical MVP scope

- **Device UI:** Clean step grid, clear labels for Drift, Rate, Scale; one accent color for “active” or “phase.”
- **Landing / Gumroad:** Same font and one accent color; hero line + short paragraph + demo + buy. No long scrolling sales letter.
- **Logo/icon:** Simple mark (e.g. two lines or circles suggesting phase/drift); works at 64×64 for device.

## 5. Content and marketing (aligned with brand)

### 5.1 Content pillars

| Pillar | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **The idea** | Explain phase sequencing and why it matters. | “What is phase-based sequencing?” (short video or post.) |
| **The instrument** | How Drifter works, no hype. | “One pattern, two playheads, drift.” Demo. |
| **The control** | Logic not AI; you’re in charge. | “You choose the pattern. We handle the phase.” |
| **The craft** | Optional: process music, Reich, your background. | “From process music to the studio.” (DMA angle, if you use it.) |

### 5.2 Fors-style product page (outline)

Use this for Gumroad long description or a simple landing page:

1. **Headline:** Drifter — Phase sequencer for Ableton (by Planedrifter)  
2. **Sub:** One pattern, many phases.  
3. **Price + [Buy]**  
4. **Paragraph 1:** “Drifter is a phase-based generative sequencer. You define a pattern; two playheads drift over it at slightly different rates. The result is endlessly shifting variations—deterministic, musical, and fully under your control. No AI, no black box: just transparent logic built for the studio.”  
5. **Paragraph 2 (optional):** “Inspired by process music: one idea, repeated and phased, creates complexity from simplicity. Drifter brings that approach into your rack.”  
6. **Demo:** [Video 2–4 min]  
7. **To sum it up:** Bullets: step sequencer, 2 playheads, drift & rate, scale quantization, snapshot, M4L.  
8. **Requirements:** Live 10.1+ Suite (or Standard + M4L), Mac/Windows.  
9. **Optional:** “Made with Drifter” or “Artist presets” when available.

### 5.3 Social and community tone

- **Reddit / forum:** Helpful, concise. “I made a phase sequencer for Ableton; here’s a short demo. Happy to answer questions.” No hype, no long copy-paste.
- **Artist / community:** When you do artist packs or “made with,” use Fors-style short bios: one sentence that’s specific and warm, not generic praise.

## 6. Checklist: brand and marketing at launch

- [ ] **Name locked:** Drifter (product); Planedrifter (brand).  
- [ ] **Tagline chosen:** e.g. “Phase-based generative sequencing.”  
- [ ] **Voice doc:** 1 page of do’s and don’ts (this section as reference).  
- [ ] **Product page:** Fors-style structure (type, price, 2 short paragraphs, demo, bullets, requirements).  
- [ ] **Device UI:** Minimal, two-tone, one accent; clear labels.  
- [ ] **Logo/icon:** Simple mark for device and favicon.  
- [ ] **Demo video:** 2–4 min; tone = clear and confident, not salesy.  
- [ ] **Launch post:** Short, helpful, “here’s what it is and a link”; no wall of copy.

## 7. Summary: Fors in one sentence

**Fors succeeds by being minimal, confident, and craft-focused: one strong name per product, short evocative copy, experience before specs, and artist-led proof—all without hype.**

Stria should mirror that: one clear idea (phase-based generative sequencing), one strong product name (Drifter), minimal confident copy, and a product that feels designed and expert-led. Use this doc and [GTM_PLAN.md](../GTM_PLAN.md) together for launch and beyond.
