# Research: Process Music

Background research on process music for Drifter (Planedrifter) positioning, copy, and education. Emphasizes Steve Reich (phasing) and the link to “phase-based generative sequencing.”

## 1. Definition

**Process music** is music in which the **compositional process and the sounding music are the same thing**. The listener hears the process as it unfolds; nothing is hidden.

- **Not** “the process of composition” (how the composer wrote the piece) but **pieces that are literally processes** — the structure is a process that runs in real time and determines both note-to-note detail and overall form at once (e.g. a round or infinite canon).
- Often grouped with **minimalism**, but Reich and others used “process” before “minimalism” was standard; process music is the systematic core of that tradition.
- **Contrast:** In serial or Cagean chance music, the *compositional* process is usually inaudible. In process music, “the composer isn’t privy to anything” — there are no structural secrets; everyone hears the same gradual unfolding.

## 2. Steve Reich, “Music as a Gradual Process” (1968)

Reich’s short essay is the main theoretical statement. Key points (paraphrased and quoted):

### 2.1 Process = sounding music

- “I do not mean the process of composition, but rather pieces of music that are, literally, processes.”
- “The distinctive thing about musical processes is that they determine all the note-to-note (sound-to-sound) details and the overall form simultaneously.”
- “What I’m interested in is a compositional process and a sounding music that are **one and the same thing**.”

### 2.2 Perceptible and gradual

- “I am interested in **perceptible processes**. I want to be able to hear the process happening throughout the sounding music.”
- “To facilitate closely detailed listening a musical process should happen **extremely gradually**.”
- “By ‘gradual’ I mean extremely gradual; a process happening so slowly and gradually that listening to it resembles watching a minute hand on a watch—you can perceive it moving after you stay with it a little while.”

### 2.3 Metaphors for listening

- Pulling back a swing, releasing it, and watching it gradually come to rest.
- Turning over an hourglass and watching the sand run through.
- Placing your feet in the sand by the ocean and watching, feeling, and listening to the waves gradually bury them.

### 2.4 Composer’s role

- “Once the process is set up and loaded it runs by itself.”
- “By ‘a kind’ of complete control I mean that by running this material through the process I completely control all that results, but also that **I accept all that results without changes**.”
- No improvisation: “One can’t improvise in a musical process—the concepts are mutually exclusive.”

### 2.5 Transparency and mystery

- “Even when all the cards are on the table and everyone hears what is gradually happening in a musical process, there are still enough mysteries to satisfy all.”
- Those mysteries are “the impersonal, unattended, psycho-acoustic by-products of the intended process”: sub-melodies, stereophonic effects, slight irregularities, harmonics, difference tones.
- “That area of every gradual (completely controlled) musical process, where one hears the details of the sound moving out away from intentions, occurring for their own acoustic reasons, is *it*.”

### 2.6 Process vs. Cage / serialism

- Cage used processes (e.g. *I Ching*) but they were **compositional** — you can’t hear them in performance. “The compositional processes and the sounding music have no audible connection.”
- In serial music, the series is seldom audible. Reich wants the process to be **fully audible**.

**Source:** “Music as a Gradual Process,” Steve Reich, 1968 (e.g. [Columbia CCNMTL](https://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/draft/ben/feld/mod1/readings/reich.html), also in *Writings on Music*, Oxford). First published in the catalogue for the Whitney Museum’s “Anti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials” (1969).

## 3. Two main process techniques

### 3.1 Phasing (Reich)

- **Idea:** Two or more identical (or near-identical) patterns run at **slightly different speeds**. They start in unison, drift out of phase, and eventually realign. The listener hears “resulting patterns”—new melodic and rhythmic combinations that emerge from the overlap.
- **Tape origin:** Reich discovered phasing by accident with two tape loops of the same material (e.g. “It’s Gonna Rain,” 1965). When one loop crept ahead of the other, the effect was “fantastic.” He controlled it by manually nudging the reels.
- **Live translation:** In *Piano Phase* (1967), two pianists play the same pattern; one gradually speeds up, then they realign. Same idea, no tape.
- **Musical effect:** At first, “a kind of shaking, a reverberation”; as phase shifts, new composite patterns appear. When the parts realign, the pattern has effectively “moved” by one step (canon effect).

### 3.2 Additive process (Glass)

- **Idea:** A short unit is repeated; notes (or beats) are **added or subtracted** over time, so the phrase expands and contracts. Rhythm and form come from this systematic growth/shrinkage.
- **Example:** A four-note figure becomes five-note, then six-note; or each chord in a progression is lengthened by adding subdivisions (e.g. *Einstein on the Beach*). Glass also uses **subtractive** process (notes removed).
- **Contrast with phasing:** Phasing keeps the *same* material and shifts its *phase* in time; additive process changes the *length or content* of the repeated unit. Both are deterministic and audible.

**For Drifter:** The device is squarely in the **phasing** tradition: same pattern, multiple playheads, drift in phase; “resulting patterns” emerge from the overlap.

## 4. Key works (concise timeline)

| Year | Work | Composer | Process type | Note |
|------|------|----------|--------------|------|
| 1964 | *In C* | Terry Riley | Open process / pulse | 53 cells, performers move at own pace; steady pulse (Reich suggested two high Cs). Often cited as launch of minimalism. |
| 1965 | *It’s Gonna Rain* | Steve Reich | Phasing (tape) | Two identical tape loops slip out of sync; speech becomes texture. |
| 1966 | *Come Out* | Steve Reich | Phasing (tape) | Same technique on a single phrase. |
| 1967 | *Piano Phase* | Steve Reich | Phasing (live) | Two pianos, same 12-note pattern; one speeds up. First live phasing. |
| 1967 | *Violin Phase* | Steve Reich | Phasing (live) | Violin + tape or multiple violins. |
| 1968 | “Music as a Gradual Process” | Steve Reich | — | Essay. |
| 1969 | *Two Pages* | Philip Glass | Additive | Repeating figure, subtractive note pattern. |
| 1971 | *Drumming* | Steve Reich | Phasing + more | Phasing between players; also rhythmic construction, timbre substitution, voice. |
| 1972 | *Clapping Music* | Steve Reich | Phase shift | Two performers, same pattern; one shifts by one beat every few bars. |

## 5. Reich’s phasing in a bit more detail

### 5.1 Tape phase (1965–66)

- **It’s Gonna Rain:** Recording of Brother Walter (preacher) in Union Square, San Francisco. Two identical loops; Reich let one drift by touching the reel. Words break into syllables; meaning gives way to rhythm and texture.
- **Come Out:** One phrase (“come out to show them”) on two loops; same technique. Phasing as “musical canon” in time.

### 5.2 Piano Phase (1967)

- Two pianos, **same 12-note pattern**. One stays fixed; the other **gradually speeds up** until it’s one note ahead, then they lock again. The cycle repeats (e.g. 12 times for full revolution).
- A second section uses an 8-note pattern; a third uses the middle four notes.
- **“Resulting patterns”:** The ear hears new melodies and harmonies from the combination of the two lines as they move in and out of phase.

### 5.3 Drumming (1970–71)

- Phasing between two players: one pattern, one player shifts tempo. Plus: building rhythms by substituting beats for rests, changing timbres (drums, voices, piccolo), and shifting between sections.

### 5.4 Why it matters for Drifter

- **One pattern, multiple “performers” (playheads)** at slightly different rates → same conceptual core.
- **Resulting patterns** = the “endlessly shifting variations” we promise; they’re not random, they’re the audible consequence of the process.
- **Perceptible and gradual** → our “drift” parameter should be slow enough to hear the process; “transparent logic” in our copy matches Reich’s “all cards on the table.”

## 6. Process music vs. other categories

| Contrast | Process music | Other |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **Improvisation** | No improv; process determines everything. | Modal/Indian frameworks allow improv within a scale/pulse. |
| **Chance (Cage)** | Process is fixed and audible. | I Ching etc. determine structure but aren’t heard in performance. |
| **Serialism** | Series/process is meant to be heard. | Series often inaudible. |
| **AI / black box** | Rules are explicit and audible. | Model’s logic is opaque. |

**Drifter angle:** “Process music” = “the process is the piece, and you can hear it.” That aligns with “logic, not AI” and “transparent, mathematical rules.”

## 7. Process music and electronic / software

- Reich: “It is quite natural to think about musical processes if one is frequently working with electro-mechanical sound equipment.” Tape and later electronics made phasing and gradual process easy to implement.
- **Generative music** (Eno, software): Often uses rules and repetition; process music is a clear precedent for “music that runs by itself” with audible rules.
- **Drifter:** Implements a **phasing process** in software: one pattern, multiple playheads, drift. The “process” is the phase relationship; the “resulting patterns” are the MIDI we output. So we can accurately say the device is “inspired by process music” or “Reich-style phasing in the rack.”

## 8. Suggested copy and education hooks

- **One-liner:** “Process music: the process *is* the piece—you hear it unfold.” Or: “One pattern, phased in time; the rest is what you hear.”
- **Reich quote (short):** “I am interested in perceptible processes. I want to be able to hear the process happening throughout the sounding music.”
- **For product:** “Drifter turns the same idea into a process: two playheads drift over your pattern. What you hear are the resulting patterns—the same principle as Reich’s *Piano Phase*, in your sequencer.”
- **Educational:** A short “What is process music?” section or video: Reich’s definition, phasing vs. additive, *Piano Phase* in 60 seconds, then “Drifter brings that process into Ableton.”
