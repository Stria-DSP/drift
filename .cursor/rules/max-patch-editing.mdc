# Max Patch Editing

**Prefer high-level spec over low-level patching instructions.**

- Describe **what** the patch does (clock → pattern lookup → MIDI; UI writes pitch/gate into coll), not detailed object-by-object wiring unless the user asks.
- Avoid editing .maxpat JSON unless necessary; patching is done in Max by the user.
- Optional: simple Mermaid or prose for signal flow. No need for inlet/outlet-level diagrams or step-by-step patching lists by default.

**gen~ / RNBO**: You can edit `.gendsp` or provide codebox/gen~ text; those are text-based.
